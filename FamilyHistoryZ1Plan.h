 * The primary index identifies relationships. It is not about events but they are used
 * to generate a link between two people. For example, each sibling attending a
 * parent's burial would have a link back to that parent. Another, assuming mother younger
 * than father, each child event would have a link to mama who in turn has a link to papa.
 * The data is sorted chronologically so age of each person can be used effectivly.
 * If a person is moved to or from a pool then everyone linked is also moved.
